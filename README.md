React JS material quizz
=========

This is a simple dynamic quizz in ReactJS designed with google material

**feature :** 

- ReactJS (> 0.14)
- Material UI 
- ES6 (*or ES2015 as it is now called since recent time*)
- jspm (*System JS and jspm = speed of light workflow from zero*) 
- babel (<6)
  - babel6 is a breaking change by itself. A new repo will be created soon with jspm-babel6.
  Right now (mid-december 2015) automatic `jspm init` will provide babel<6
- a simple hello world component (see : `./src/app/**`).
